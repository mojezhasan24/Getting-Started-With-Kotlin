## 🖥️ How to Install Kotlin

### Windows

1. **Install Java JDK:**  
   Download and install [OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/) or [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
2. **Download Kotlin Compiler:**  
   - Go to [Kotlin Releases](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases) and download the latest compiler zip.
   - Extract it to a folder (e.g., `C:\kotlin`).
   - Add the `bin` folder to your system `PATH`.
3. **Verify Installation:**  
   Open Command Prompt and run:
   ```sh
   kotlinc -version
   ```

### Linux

1. **Install Java JDK:**  
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
   ```
2. **Install Kotlin via SDKMAN (recommended):**  
   ```sh
   curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
   source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
   sdk install kotlin
   ```
   Or, download and extract the compiler from [Kotlin Releases](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases).
3. **Verify Installation:**  
   ```sh
   kotlinc -version
   ```

### macOS

1. **Install Java JDK:**  
   ```sh
   brew install openjdk@17
   ```
2. **Install Kotlin via Homebrew (recommended):**  
   ```sh
   brew install kotlin
   ```
   Or, use SDKMAN as shown above for Linux.
3. **Verify Installation:**  
   ```sh
   kotlinc -version
   ```

## ⚠️ Precautions & Best Practices

- **Always download software from official or trusted sources** to avoid malware.
- **Set your PATH carefully:** When adding Java or Kotlin to your system PATH, double-check the folder path to avoid breaking other tools.
- **Use the correct JDK version:** Kotlin works best with JDK 8 or newer. If you have multiple JDKs, make sure the correct one is active.
- **Be careful with the `!!` operator in Kotlin:** It will throw an exception if the value is null. Use safe calls (`?.`) or null checks for production code.
- **Keep your tools updated:** Regularly update Java, Kotlin, and your IDE for the latest features and security patches.
- **On shared or school computers:** You may need admin rights to install software. Ask your system administrator if you encounter permission issues.
- **Backup your code:** Use version control (like Git) to keep your work safe.
